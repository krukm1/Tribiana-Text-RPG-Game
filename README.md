# Tribiana-Text-RPG-Game
A simple text-based fantasy game where you create a character, choose a race and class, and battle a randomly generated monster. Built with Python.

While creating Tribiana, I picked up a few valuable lessons along the way:
1. âœ… Confirmation checkpoints after character creation and before battle help players avoid accidental choices â€” a simple feature that improves user experience.
2. ðŸ’¡ I learned how to convert a .py file into a .exe using PyInstaller, which was a fun challenge and super useful for sharing the game with non-programmers.
3. ðŸ‘€ When I first converted the game into a .exe, it would instantly close after a win or loss. I added an option to exit or restart, so players can see the outcome before choosing to close the window.
4. ðŸ§  I realized that keeping both the player and monster under the same character class wasnâ€™t ideal. Separating them would have made things more scalable â€” a useful lesson for future projects.
